/*
 * EX 4.8
 * The implementation of map2 on the Either trait is only able to report one error,
 * even if both name and age are invalid. What would you need to change in order
 * to report both errors? Would you change the signature of map2 or the signature
 * of mkPerson? Or could you create a new data type that captures this requirement
 * better than Either does, with some additional structure? How would orElse,
 * traverse and sequence behave differently fot his data type?
 * 
 * There are a number of variations on `Option` and `Either`. If
 * we want to accumulate multiple errors, a simple approach is a new data type
 * that lets us keep a list of errors in the data constructor that represents failures:
 * 
 * This type is called `Validation` in the Scalaz library.
 * You can implement `map`, `map2`, `sequence`, and so on for this type in such a way
 * that errors are accumulated when possible. (This idea can even be generalized further -
 * we don't need to accumulate failing values into a list, we can accumulate values using
 * any user-supplied binary function)
 * 
 * It's also possible to use `Either[List[E],_]` directly to accumulate errors,
 * using different implementations of helper functions like `map2` and `sequence`.
